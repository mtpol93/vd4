This is a placeholder for the Agentic overview image. 

Since I cannot create binary image files, you'll need to manually add the overview image for Agentic at:
/public/products/ai-core/products/Agentic/0-overview/overview.jpg

The ProductModal component will automatically detect and use this image when it exists.
